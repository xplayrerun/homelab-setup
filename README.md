# HomeLab Setup Scripts ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This repository contains setup scripts for my personal AI workstation: **HomeLab 1.0**. It runs Ubuntu 22.04 and includes NVIDIA GPU drivers, Python tooling, and a full data science and deep learning environment.

---

## ðŸ’¾ Contents

- `setup-homelab-pre.sh`  
  Installs system packages and NVIDIA drivers. Run this **before reboot**.

- `setup-homelab-post.sh`  
  Installs Miniconda, PyTorch with GPU support, and common AI libraries. Run this **after reboot**.

---

## ðŸ§° What's Installed

### System & GPU
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- NVIDIA Driver 535
- Dev tools (`build-essential`, `git`, `tmux`, etc.)

### Python & AI Libraries
- **Python 3.11** (via Conda)
- **PyTorch** with CUDA 11.8 support
- **Transformers** â€“ Pretrained NLP and LLM models
- **Datasets** â€“ Hugging Face dataset manager
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Traditional machine learning
- **Pandas** â€“ Tabular data processing
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **JupyterLab** â€“ Web-based notebook interface

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xplayrerun/homelab-setup.git
   cd homelab-setup
   ```

2. Run the pre-reboot setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-homelab-pre.sh
   ./setup-homelab-pre.sh
   ```

3. Reboot the system.

4. Run the post-reboot setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-homelab-post.sh
   ./setup-homelab-post.sh
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists

This is my personal AI workstation, built for:
- Learning PyTorch, Hugging Face, and GPU workloads
- Experimenting with LLMs and model fine-tuning
- Automating reproducible system setup from scratch

---

## ðŸ”’ Notes

- Conda environments are not committed to version control
- You should install this only on personal, secure machines

---

## ðŸ§ª Future Plans

- Add Docker & `nvidia-container-toolkit`
- Setup VSCode Remote SSH
- Create launchers for JupyterLab or specific model tasks
